                Operating revenues for the financial year 2015/16, without taking into account capital gains obtained as a result of player transfers, have topped 600 million euros for the first time, reaching a figure of 620.1 million euros, a 7.4% increase on the previous financial year.

                The operating result before repayments and player transfers (“recurring EBITDA”) has risen to 163.2 million euros, which is the highest figure ever reached by the club, representing a 26.3% increase on revenue figures and a rise of 20.9% on the previous financial year. This improvement in profitability is due to an increase in revenues having subtracted operating expenses and provisions corresponding to risks and contingencies.

            <td>
                A pre-tax profit of 43.3 million euros has been recorded, which is 22.5% less than the previous financial year. This is due to the non-recurrent effect of player transfers, despite the operating improvements recorded. After achieving a net profit (after tax) of 30.3 million euros, net worth has risen to 442.2 million euros.
